Really simple scale generator. Takes key and mode to generate
a scale, the I, IV, and V chords, and the VI minor chord - so
that ye may jam freely from a key and a mode.

Music theory likely not perfect, and Tab Widget in the middle
in case I decide to ever add muscial notation (using ABC Shot
or abc.js).

To build:

Made using Qt, as a regular Qt project. Open in QtCreator, or
build using qmake.
